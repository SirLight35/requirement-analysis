This repository contains the Requirement Analysis Project for a Booking Management System, developed as part of a structured learning module on software development methodologies. 
The purpose of this repository is to document, analyze, and structure all software requirements that form the foundation for building a scalable and efficient booking platform.

It includes detailed documentation of functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, reflecting real-world industry standards. 
By completing this project, the aim is to demonstrate a solid understanding of the Requirement Analysis phase within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ‚Äî ensuring that the system design and development
are aligned with user and business needs.

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the development team clearly understands what to build and why.

During this phase, analysts work with stakeholders, end users, and project managers to gather requirements, define functional and non-functional needs, and create documentation that guides the design and implementation stages.

Requirement Analysis is crucial because it bridges the gap between business objectives and technical implementation, ensuring that the final product meets both user expectations and business goals.

üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Prevents Miscommunication:
It ensures that all stakeholders ‚Äî including developers, clients, and end users ‚Äî share a unified understanding of project goals and deliverables.

Saves Time and Cost:
By identifying issues early in the development process, Requirement Analysis helps avoid costly rework and project delays.

Defines Clear Project Scope:
It sets clear boundaries for what the project will and won‚Äôt include, preventing scope creep and helping maintain focus on critical features.

üß± Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Gathering:
Collecting raw information from stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires, and observation.

Requirement Elicitation:
Refining and elaborating on gathered information using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and use case analysis.

Requirement Documentation:
Organizing and recording the finalized requirements in formal documents such as the Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
Analyzing the relationships between requirements, identifying dependencies, and modeling system interactions using diagrams or flowcharts.

Requirement Validation:
Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, feasibility, and alignment with business goals.

‚öôÔ∏è Types of Requirements
üß© Functional Requirements

Definition:
Functional requirements specify what the system should do ‚Äî the specific features, actions, or tasks it must perform.

Examples for Booking Management System:

Users can search for available properties by location, date, and price.

The system allows user registration and login with secure authentication.

Users can book and cancel reservations through the platform.

Admins can add, update, or remove property listings.

‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements

Definition:
Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs its functions ‚Äî including performance, security, usability, and reliability.

Examples for Booking Management System:

The system must load pages within 2 seconds.

User data should be encrypted for security.

The system should be available 99.9% of the time.

The platform must support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance issues.

üéØ Use Case Diagrams

Definition:
A Use Case Diagram visually represents the interaction between actors (users or external systems) and the system itself. It helps developers and stakeholders understand the functional scope of the system at a glance.

Benefits:

Clarifies system functionality.

Identifies user interactions and system boundaries.

Serves as a communication tool between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

Definition:
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be accepted by stakeholders. They ensure that each feature aligns with user expectations and business goals.

Importance:

Provides measurable goals for development and testing.

Ensures clear communication of what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means for each feature.

Helps prevent misunderstandings during delivery and review stages.

Example ‚Äì Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria:

The user must be able to view a summary of their booking before confirming payment.

The system must validate payment details and display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

Upon successful payment, the system should generate a booking confirmation and email it to the user.

The checkout process must complete within 10 seconds under normal conditions.
