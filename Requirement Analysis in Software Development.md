This repository contains the Requirement Analysis Project for a Booking Management System, developed as part of a structured learning module on software development methodologies. 
The purpose of this repository is to document, analyze, and structure all software requirements that form the foundation for building a scalable and efficient booking platform.

It includes detailed documentation of functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, reflecting real-world industry standards. 
By completing this project, the aim is to demonstrate a solid understanding of the Requirement Analysis phase within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) â€” ensuring that the system design and development
are aligned with user and business needs.
